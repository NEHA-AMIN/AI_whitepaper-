ðŸ“„ Setting up and Running the Flask & Dash App
Dependencies Installation
Before running the app, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using pip:
Install the required Python packages:
pip install Flask google-generativeai markdown2 pdfkit dash
Additionally, you need to install wkhtmltopdf for PDF generation (explained below).
Install wkhtmltopdf:
1. On Ubuntu/Linux:â€¨sudo apt update
2. sudo apt install wkhtmltopdf
3. 
4. On MacOS (using Homebrew):â€¨brew install wkhtmltopdf
5. 
6. On Windows:
    * Download from here.
    * Install and add the bin folder to your System PATH.

Python App - Required Imports
The app requires the following Python libraries. Here's the list of imports that you'll use in app.py:
import os
import uuid
import json
from flask import Flask, jsonify, send_file, request
import google.generativeai as genai
import markdown2
import pdfkit
import dash
from dash import html, dcc
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output, State

Running the App
Once you've installed all dependencies and set up wkhtmltopdf, you can run the Flask & Dash app locally.
Steps to run the app:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your app.py is located.
3. Run the app with the following command:â€¨python app.py
4. 
5. After running the command, you should see something like this:â€¨Starting server on port 8051
6. 
7. Access the app:
    * Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:8051/dash/ to use the Dash UI for generating whitepapers.
    * The API for generating reports can be accessed at: http://localhost:8050/generate.

Troubleshooting
1. PDF Generation Issue (No wkhtmltopdf found)
* If you encounter the error:â€¨No wkhtmltopdf executable found: "b''", it means wkhtmltopdf is not installed correctly. Ensure it's installed and accessible via your systemâ€™s PATH.
2. Gemini API Key Error
* If the Gemini AI not initialized error occurs, make sure you have set up your Google Gemini API key correctly.
* Example for setting up in app.py:â€¨api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
* 
3. Missing Libraries
* If you see import errors like ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xxxx', ensure youâ€™ve installed the necessary libraries with pip install.

By following these steps and ensuring the dependencies are in place, you should be able to run the app smoothly! ðŸŽ‰
